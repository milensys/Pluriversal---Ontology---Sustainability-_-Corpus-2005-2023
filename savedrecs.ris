AB  - In this article we argue that sustainable development is not a socio-ecologically friendly principle. The principle, which is deeply embedded in environmental law, policymaking and governance, drives environmentally destructive neoliberal economic growth that exploits and degrades the vulnerable living order. Despite seemingly well-meaning intentions behind the emergence of sustainable development, it almost invariably facilitates exploitative economic development activities that exacerbate systemic inequalities and injustices without noticeably protecting all life forms in the Anthropocene. We conclude the article by examining an attempt to construct alternatives to sustainable development through the indigenous onto-epistemology of buen vivir. While no panacea, buen vivir is a worldview that offers the potential to critically rethink how environmental law could re-orientate away from its 'centered', gendered and anthropocentric, neoliberal sustainable development ontology, to a radically different ontology that embraces ecologically sustainable ways of seeing, being, knowing and caring.

KW  - social change
KW  - utopia
AB  - Since intersectionality theory constitutes a critical assessment of the way the social world operates and strives for social justice, it entails an image of how the world is and how things could become. In this article a version of intersectionality with particularly strong counter-cultural tendencies is considered. Drawing on Ruth Levitas's approach to utopia as 'method', it makes explicit pluriversal intersectionality's utopian content. It is shown that the defining features of this intersectionality theory share an elective affinity with the principle of self-management lying at the core of the libertarian strand of socialist thought. But the utopia whose contours are drawn here is not expected to act as a blueprint. Instead, the article aspires to serve as an invitation to dialogue about the kind of future that could lie beyond intersectional oppression and, consequently, help consolidate pluriversal intersectionality's transformative potential.

KW  - Worlding
AB  - Bringing ontological questions back into IR has been key to opening discussions about plurality and difference in terms of the coexistence of related and plural worlds and realities, for example through notions such as relationality and pluriversality. The problem is that in trying to develop relational approaches as an alternative to the 'Western/modern' - atomistic - ontology, relationality, relations, and their meanings can become fixed, translating them into 'things'. The article maintains that cosmopraxis - as a complex pluriversal, multidimensional set of experiences - not only illustrates how relations relate without fixing their meaning, but also provides us with relevant insights to contribute to think of a pluriversal and more plural IR.

AB  - Ecopedagogy is a viable pathway towards a pluriversal education system that attends to both global ecological concerns and various local expressions of interests, working towards socioenvironmental justice and a Freirean critical (eco)pedagogy. Ethnographic examples of environmental education in rural Costa Rica emerging from my case study of Samuel, the creative, music educator in La Palma, demonstrate a variety of pedagogical tactics used to generate ecological awareness and create sustainability-minded citizens. Through lively and engaging activities with young students, ecopedagogy serves as a potential pathway between pluriversal education and normative environmentalism. This ethnographic analysis of ecopedagogy in practice within Costa Rica's Osa Peninsula illuminates the tension between an imposition of values and the generation of pluriversal education through dynamic pedagogical influence, structured play, embodied practice, and decentring the human.

Exploring how the use of design tools and frameworks (e.g., boundary objects and infrastructuring) can help build out a decolonial imaginary, the article demonstrates how- through our design practice- we are able to successfully acknowledge, and work with, different "ways of being" in the world.

AB  - This paper makes the case that a Pluriversal Social Design should be desire-based. It suggests that the creation of meaningful social change requires moving the focus of design processes from needs to agentic desires. The author understands agentic desire as the creative impulse towards human flourishing. In social design, the current emphasis on needs makes designers continually reproduce the Eurocentric model of life, hindering the creation of genuine alternatives. Moreover, centering collaborative relationships (designing with) on people's basic needs is often disempowering. Desire-based design is a transformative practice that aims to break with normalcy and orthodoxy (i.e. the familiar way of doing things) to create and recognize alternatives. In the typical process, the designer starts with a need or problem and looks for a desirable solution. This paper suggests the opposite, engaging with desire as a starting point, in an open-ended exploration, and emphasizing people's agency.

AB  - In recent years, emerging work from the "southern" and "south/eastern" contexts has widened the theoretical discussion and the geographical focus of the contemporary planning debate. Inspired by Arturo Escobar's notion of the "Pluriverse," this article proposes a "pluriversal planning scholarship," to articulate the theoretical and community-based contributions of an evolving stream of planning research that embraces multiplicity, coexistence, and critical thinking. Through a review of over 300 publications in top planning journals, we suggest that pluriversal scholars engage in creative methodologies to do community-based work. They contribute to extending planning theory by drawing from other fields, such as Black feminism, decolonial thought, and Indigenous studies to highlight the everyday experiences and resistances of residents despite a state that is failing them. Additionally, they actively contribute to community-based work through reciprocal theory development with community members, capacity building, and visibilizing residents' stories when appropriate.

AB  - Coalitional politics have largely been examined across social and cultural differences that serve shared political commitments, and the rhetorical force of situated and material locations remains an open question. To provide a theoretical analytic for these excesses, I offer pluriversal and rhetorical understandings of divergence and diplomacy for coalitional politics. I demonstrate these concepts through a rhetorical analysis of a community organization from San Antonio, Texas, and their coalitional politics, which partially emerge as a response to extreme weather events and urban development. The upshot reveals that rhetorical approaches to divergence and diplomacy can help capture the material obligations and constraints across heterogeneous yet interdependent worlds. Such theoretical tools will be increasingly important for coalitional rhetorics and politics responding to climate breakdown.

AB  - A pluriversal encounter that includes interlocutors from other ways of knowing and being requires recrafting how we commonly approach ontology in IR. Our shared ontological register only acknowledges separation as the fundamental existential assumption, and not all lifeways depart from this assumption. The article prods us to move beyond considering ontology as the study of being, a more substantialist reading, to include other fundamental existential commitments so that we can address how distinct presuppositions shape and are shaped by how we perceive and engage existence. With this reorientation, the article first establishes how even relational approaches in the discipline, including variations of constructivism, poststructuralism, and new materialism privilege separation as the primordial condition of existence to the exclusion of any other option. A conceptual toolset is then elaborated to examine how a singular commitment to separation constitutes an ontological parochialism that enforces reductionism, exclusion, and domination towards lifeways that embrace the interconnection as fundamental existential commitment. Even though more effective engagement across pluriversal worlds would be crucial for developing more complex tools for confronting the current planetary crisis, the discipline's reductionist concept of ontology itself keeps us quite far from effectively being able to engage in such an exchange.

AB  - This brief commentary draws on Stuart Elden's thought provoking article, 'Terrain, Politics, History', to make two interventions. The first argues that understandings of terrain and Earth's materiality would be enriched by engaging with 'pluriversal' perspectives where Earth is inherently animated, lively, and heterogenous. This includes indigenous perspectives and those attending to non-human animal life. The second calls for a more concerted engagement within geography with terrains as voluminous constructs, whether that be in mountains, the air, or increasingly in artificial environments. It concludes by advocating for a further stretching of 'terrain' as presented in the paper to see where diverse understandings of terrain might land or indeed, climb, float, sink, or soar.

AB  - This article seeks to reconceptualise emancipation in critically theorising International Relations (IR) by developing 'thin' and 'thick' versions of normativity and applying them as conditions for a pluriversal dialogue between different cosmologies. We start with the premise that 'critical IR' is both Eurocentric and a-normative, and argue that a normative engagement with critical discourses both inside and outside the West is necessary to recapture its emancipatory promise. Drawing on the work of Max Horkheimer, Herbert Marcuse and Jacques Derrida, we develop 'thin' and 'thick' versions of normativity. The former, we argue, operates as a critical corrective of thick normative positions, reclaiming their openness to difference, while not making substantive moral or political claims itself. We then apply these version of normativity to examine the possibility of a global pluriversal dialogue between different cosmologies. Cosmologies, we argue, refer to sets of ontological and epistemological claims about the human condition that are inherently normative. 'Thin' normativity applied to the 'thick' claims of cosmologies prevents the essentialisation and hierarchisation of cosmological difference(s) by revealing and de-constructing the latter's potentially discriminatory, exclusionary, and violent tendencies. In so doing, it facilitates a global inter-cosmological dialogue which we regard as the objective of a post-western, critical IR.

AB  - This paper makes the case for an approach to International Relations in the Anthropocene, which draws upon resources from critical Black studies. This distinctive perspective is set out in comparison to two, more familiar, sets of critical Anthropocene thought, that have been influential in contemporary discussions of global politics. We heuristically frame these as the "Planetary" - a focus on ontology and vibrant and unruly materiality - and the "Pluriversal" - which places race and coloniality at the centre of our understanding of power and knowledge. We suggest that Planetary approaches underestimate the centrality of race and coloniality to questions of ontology and that Pluriversal approaches are often undermined by a failure to take ontology more seriously. These literatures are opposed to a third perspective, which we call the "Black Horizon", which troubles our approach to alterity and works with a non- or para-ontological understanding of being.

AB  - This article examines, with ethnographic lenses, the emergence of shared networks in the Tseltal and Zapoteco communities in Chiapas and Oaxaca (Mexico). 'Shared networks' are first-mile signal-sharing practices that articulate interconnection infrastructure and values of coexistence to, in the cases studied, extend the internet to areas where the services of existing larger internet service providers are unsatisfactory or unavailable. It argues that by infrastructuring their own local networks and interconnecting to the global internet, Tseltal and Zapoteco people are effectively internet codesigners, building Latin-Centric Indigenous networks and shaping internet governance from below. When comunalidad values, supported by unlicensed frequencies of the electromagnetic spectrum, towers, radio antennas, houses' rooftops, routers, and cables, intersect with the values of the internet service providers and their policies, hybrids emerge. Shared networks are a result of what these hybrids enact and constrain, as well as evidence of the vivid struggles for a more inclusive and pluriversal internet.

AB  - This article discusses the performance I Promise You That Tonight created by artists Tom Cassani and Peader Kirk. The article is written from a practitioner's perspective and discusses strategies of both stage magic and live art used in the show as a means to create multiple, simultaneous realities for an audience. Theoretical perspectives from postcolonial and post-developmental thought are used to work through the ontological impact of these co-present realities in performance, in particular, Arturo Escobar's concept of Pluriversal Politics (2020). The discussion is focused on the main act of the performance, walking barefoot on broken glass. The article aims to highlight how methods of trickery can enable a range of complementary conceptions of an event to emerge. We explore this in reference to both a contemporary and historical positioning of magic and its theatrical and narrative methods. Beginning with the notion that in a post-truth world access to a universal, objective scientific worldview is contested, we discuss truth and reality in relation to a possible space where a range of world models might work together in complementarity: a pluriverse. This article argues that the use of magic and live art in I Promise You That Tonight conjures up such a pluriversal opportunity. The article proposes that stage magic inverts the theatrical suspension of disbelief into an expectation of deception (even a desire to be deceived). Staging the irrational and impossible to point to the risks of credulity or, conversely, staging something that is in fact completely real but which the audience's sense of reality tells them can only be an illusion, like walking on broken glass and not being cut. We conclude by suggesting that I Promise You That Tonight constitutes a practical research into pluriversal performance through a purposeful inversion of the tropes of magical performance.

AB  - This study critically examines the concept of political CSR, or legitimacy creation through deliberation, as something that can be universally agreed upon in places where incommensurable differences exist. Through a comparative case study of two local stakeholder groups - one urban and one rural - involved in a conflict over a pulp mill in the south of Chile, this paper asks: 1) why did the two groups choose different participation strategies in the deliberation over the desirability of the mill? Based on multiple data sources, the study finds differences in how each community made sense of the world through place-bound social imaginaries, which affected the stakeholders' willingness to participate in deliberation. The findings suggest that legitimacy cannot be universally secured through dialogues that seek consensus at the expense of occluded imaginaries, rather it exists as a pluriversal construct. If political CSR is to play a role in legitimacy creation across imaginaries, the focus should be on constructing economic alternatives embedded in place that supports the co-existence of different forms of life.

AB  - Indigenous migrants are often treated without regard for their status as Indigenous Peoples, as if their migrant status would hierarchically supersede their Indigenous one. The flow of Indigenous migrants from Venezuela to neighboring countries has largely increased over the years. Currently, there are several Indigenous Peoples from Venezuela in Brazil. This evaluative interdisciplinary research addresses the relations between Indigenous and migration human rights protection with consideration for decolonial perspectives. It questions how living coloniality impacts Indigenous migrants' rights, leading to their intersectional invisibility, and how decolonial views on human rights may help overcoming these challenges. It claims that a decolonial perspective on human rights rooted in the pluriverse may situate human rights as emancipatory scripts when led by Indigenous cosmologies. Ultimately, this article aims to contribute to critical understandings on the intersectional oppression faced by Indigenous migrants and, by calling for a shift towards pluriversal approaches to their human rights, illustrate possible paths to the realization of Indigenous migrants' rights and the need to decolonize their lived realities. This may inform potential directions for decolonizing the human rights agenda as well as the law and practice of human rights in the case of Indigenous migrants in Latin America.

AB  - This article describes and analyses an encounter in the Colombian Amazon between Indigenous practices and arrangements to manage their environment and the conservation policies of the State. Indigenous peoples understand their world as populated by powerful human and nonhuman beings; for them, the moral duty of achieving happiness and abundance for all implies sustaining reciprocal and respectful relations with these beings (including the State). In contrast Colombian environmental policy distinguishes between nature and culture, seeking to safeguard landscapes from human interference so that natural processes can unfold unhindered. In practice these partially connected, yet incommensurable worldviews make for a 'perfect storm' opening opportunities for illegal mining. Drawing on recent fieldwork among the Andoke, an ethnic group well acquainted with extractivism in its different historical modalities and presently affronting the fallout of gold dredge mining we narrate how a parallel, non-state governance system makes it difficult for them to care for their land and entertain mutual and respectful relations with human and nonhuman beings (which we translate as 'territorial health'). We conclude by arguing for the need to re-imagine environmental governance in ways that more closely engage with what we call pluriversal governance: a form of (environmental) governance that does ontological justice to those involved in the environmental conflict - including, crucially, Indigenous people.

AB  - This essay examines the idea of the pluriverse as one response to recent calls for the decolonization of international and global ethics. It argues that taking pluriversality seriously challenges prevailing understandings of global ethics as the acquisition and application of moral expertise. Instead of aiming to know the meaning of global justice and then apply it to particular contexts, a pluriversal ethics addresses the question of how to cultivate a practical ethic of coexistence and collaboration with others in an ontologically plural and radically hierarchical world.

AB  - This intervention critiques the rationale which underpins the authority of the food system as a context for sustainability, resilience and self-organisation. We apply learning from embodied practice, in particular The Food Journey (c), to demonstrate the existence of harm and trauma arising from the overrepresentation of the liberal model of Man as constituting the only reality of humanity. This model has, in reality been a colonial, capitalising force of violent dispossession. It is this context that has produced global circulations of agricultural produce, systematised by a colonialism which violates the integrity of all that it encounters as different. Colonialities of being, power and knowledge extract and exploit globally both people and places as legacies of colonialism and perpetuate an abyssal divide between worlds. We unsettle and reconfigure both geopolitical contemporary and historic accounts of food-related narratives. We do this to help reveal how the 'food system' is actually a mainly Euro-American-centred narrative of dispossession, presented as universal. We propose the use of decolonial tools that are pluriversal, ecological and embodied as a means of interrogating the present system design, including its academic and field practice. The embrace of decolonial tools have the potential to take us beyond mere emancipation, cutting through old definitions and understandings of how food sovereignty, farm production, land justice and food itself are understood and applied as concepts. The outcome-as a continuous process of engagement, learning and redefinition-can then lead us towards a relational pluriverse as an expression of freedom and full nourishment for all humans and for the Earth, which is, in itself, a necessary healing.

AB  - Purpose From a Latin American decolonial and transdisciplinary perspective, this article expands the increasingly relevant conversation about disaster ethics, not only in depth and scope but also both interdisciplinarily and interculturally. By reviewing key points of development ethics that are closely related but underexplored, it makes the case for focusing on disaster recovery as a relevant distributive phase for improving future prevention and mitigation, while remedying long-standing injustices. Design/methodology/approach To do so, against the backdrop of recently emerging postcolonial, decolonial and structural approaches to disaster and vulnerability studies, the article presents a theoretical conversation between decolonial studies, development ethics, intercultural practice and philosophy, and disaster ethics beyond utilitarian approaches. Findings So far, development and disaster ethics remain worlds apart, despite their relevant convergence around the key notion of "recovery" and its underlying normative determination. This article identifies that prevailing utilitarian ethics in emergency response, in addition to their problematic universalization, have prevented further engagement with deontological and process-based principles, including a nuanced distributive sensitivity. As a result of such cross-fertilization, methodological individualism in an intercultural encounter is suggested, as well as continued engagement with pluriversal deliberation about key ethical values and notions regarding disaster risk and response. Originality/value Calling for distributive bottom-up engagement beyond professional and academic boundaries, this article presents a new direction for decolonising disaster ethics, so far unexplored, seeking to bridge the value gap between development and disaster efforts, planning and prevention.

I seek, first, to explain what problems scholars are seeking to solve with these interventions; second, I point to certain missteps that have been made as part of these solutions, particularly in relation to human-centredness in conceptions of practice-based ontologies; and third, I draw attention to the dangers involved in assuming that the pluriverse will not be governed by power imbalances similar to those found in a one-world world.

AB  - Recognizing the fluidity around the definitions and boundaries of Islamic psychology (IP), I propose that the assumption of decolonial thought may help IP reimagine its vision, orientation, and directions. Distinguished by three fundamentals - epistemic freedom, liberation, and humanization - paradigmatic IP may harvest psycho-spiritual, cognitive, and affective resources as well as methodological, ethical, and metaphysical substance through the creation of an archive of Islamic humanism to speak back to all areas of psychology and cognate disciplines focused on human behavior. The espousal of decolonial thought locates IP within larger bodies of solidarity and decolonizing scholarship committed to pluriversal and transformatory enactments of knowledge.

AB  - In this essay we seek to reflect on black educational experiences in Brazil - particularly in the context of Bahia - observing from a methodological perspective the forms that constitute capoeira, sambas de roda and afro blocks as African civilizing horizons, whose diaspora context has engendered emancipatory educational experiences from pluriversal epistemological dialogues. In this sense, the reflection carried out here brought, as an addition, the emergence of thinking about such pedagogical-educational knowledge and practices deriving from the black populations in Brazil, as an inclusive and diverse path of artistic teaching and learning.

AB  - The expressions Management and Organization Studies and Management and Organization Knowledge are expressions of an Anglo-Saxon construct. The association of Organization Studies (OS) with Management (M) produces the subordination of the former to the latter. In a different direction, a critical approach elaborated in Brazilian OS provides an original body of knowledge that expresses an anti-management (A-M) attitude. As the Brazilian A-M authors point out, the distinction between North/South M is irrelevant; what is relevant is a coherent pluriversal A-M attitude. In this paper, we honor and disseminate the Brazilian original body of knowledge on OS and introduce an OS agenda that is liberated from M.

AB  - The writings of TH Marshall, Esping Anderson and other welfare state scholars have been concerned with class-based inequalities bought about through capitalism. Yet the focus on exploitation of labour overlooks racialised and gendered inequalities bought about through historic and contemporary processes of expropriation also inherent in capitalism. In this paper, I argue that addressing processes of expropriation are fundamental to the political economy of the welfare state and propose a reparative way of thinking to transform the welfare state. Drawing on insights from the transformative reparation literature, I outline three modes of transformation - unsettling accumulation by dispossession, disrupting dehumanising subjectivities and supporting pluriversal possibilities as processes to transform the structures that uphold expropriation and the welfare state.

AB  - This article investigates the disciplinary denials of subjectivities and pluriversal nature of creative business education, examining the interdisciplinary limits of its curriculum produced in response to neoliberal crisis in business education. While creative business education is depicted as an alternative way out to regain the legitimacy of mainstream business school education and its dynamism, the programmes often recycled that upholds market values of compliant culture that destroys creativity of labour and the criticality of educational process. It highlights the continuity and growth of alienation within the interdisciplinary praxis of creative business education. It argues against the use of language, methods and conceptual narratives of traditional business education within creative business education for a radical transformation of business praxis that values people, planet and society.

AB  - Little research exists on how alternative understandings of sustainability and societal well-being, such as those developed by marginalized Indigenous populations, can enrich and possibly challenge dominant visions of sustainability anchored in Western discourses on sustainable development and ecological modernization. This paper addresses this research gap in the context of the transition towards low-carbon energy sources by addressing the following question: how do Indigenous worldviews contrast with modernist visions of sustainability in the context of the energy transition? To do so, it first builds a conceptual framework contrasting modernist and Indigenous sustainability worldviews. Second, it applies this framework to the case of wind energy developments within the territory of three Zapotec communities located in southern Mexico, with the discussion relying on 103 interviews with key stakeholders, six focus groups and participant observation. Results show that the Zapotec sustainability worldview contrasts strikingly with wind developers' modernist propositions, which tend to reproduce the region's past colonial arrangements in terms of cultural domination, non-recognition of Indigenous identities and disrespect for local customs. This contrast has led to many conflicts and misunderstandings around wind energy projects. The paper concludes that different conceptualizations of sustainability must be recognized to ensure an inclusive and just energy transition, and advances the concept of "pluriversal technologies" to emphasize the need for technologies that embrace ontological and epistemological diversity by being co-designed, co-produced and co-owned by the inhabitants of the socio-cultural territory in which they are embedded.

This article will address the embodied nature of collaborative creative process at a distance. Using Walter Mignolo's 'pluriversal worlds' as a starting point, the article will explore how artists can maintain collaborative migrant knowledge production across geographical and imaginary spaces. We will analyse the digital dialogue commission 'Third Nature' and how it applied the Authentic Movement somatic dyadic technique in a digital format. The article will also reflect on how the 'third nature' co-sharing and co-witnessing process allowed the artists to dwell in the imaginary and natural border territory and to still feel upheld by one another.

Our collective biography brings into focus how we engaged in common wadding in our childhoods through dreaming, metamorphosis, and play by tactfully moving across different worlds and learning with the human and mare-than-human others we encountered. As we foreground childhood memory and its potential to reimagine pasts, presents, and futures, we explore what kind of conditions are necessary to (re)attune ourselves to the multiple worlds around us in order to maintain and nurture children's-and our own-other-worldly connections.

AB  - Clearly in contrast to the sociosymbolic approaches that underlie the positions of Butler or Derrida, this article delves into a materialist and machinic reading of the ontology of Deleuze and Guattari. This ontology is the basis of a posthumanist conception that allows to join political philosophy, technology and biology understood as complex rhizomatic systems. From this point of view, we propose to construct an antagonistic posthumanist politics that is an alternative to the pluriversal ethics defended by Braidotti. We believe that the latter maintains an excessively liberal position that prioritizes inclusion as a new form of consensus in the face of conflict.

AB  - This essay explores the potential of solidarity economy (SE) as theory, practice, and movement, to engender an ontological politics to create and sustain other worlds that can resolve the existential crises of ecological destruction and historic inequalities. We argue that such a politics is necessary to go beyond the world as it is and exceed the dictates of a dominant modernity-capitalism, white supremacy, patriarchy-that positions itself as the only singular reality-or One World World (Law J (2011) What's Wrong with a One World World. Heterogeneities. ). What is needed are alternatives to development in contrast to alternative developments. Over the past decade, the SE movement in Massachusetts has advanced a fight and build approach, which has reframed economy as a matter of concern, as something that communities can, and already do, shape themselves-and that powerfully disrupts the reality of a singular capitalist economy. At the same time, the heterogeneous elements of SE are caught up in and assembling political projects with multiple orientations: modernist, social justice, and ontological (Escobar, Pluriversal politics: the real and the possible, Duke University Press, Durham, 2020). SE movement can remain stuck in a modernist politics of growing and scaling businesses and jobs. Even though a social justice approach attends to power and is more amenable to a relational view of reality where things only exist in interconnection, it too can remain mired in One World World liberal politics of redistribution and market 'solutions'. How SE movement might actualize an ontological politics is a matter of care, an attunement to how relational worlds are coming into being and maintained. As an ontological politics, SE is not about economy qua economy at all, but about creating and sustaining worlds, pluriversal realities where we can be in solidarity with other people, beings, and planetary life systems.

AB  - Extending the philosopher Achille Mbembe's notion of the 'seeing power of race' in Critique of Black Reason, this paper explores the imperial frame - a racialized and racializing vision of singularity/alterity - that was foundational to European modernity and the formation of the modern world. I intend to show how the racialized have always articulated an otherwise for cultivating a humane relationship with difference, an unconditional relationship with humanity, through (knowingly or unknowingly) putting the rhetoric of modernity/coloniality on trial. Interweaving a discussion of the 2014 Jordanian film Theeb (trans: Wolf) - our decolonial text - I propose a framework, a series of commitments for a culture decolonized: to time as (re)enchanted and emerging; space as pluriversal and planetary; and self as the guarantor for the Other's share.

AB  - The museum imagination that emerged in the sixties installed a new paradigm that has sought for museums to assume a social function, express and resolve the concerns of their community and give a sense of place. A study is presented on community-based museums in the Los Rios Region that represent some of the ideals of this New Museology. The purpose is to understand how objects and manifestations reveal situated heritigization processes that, mediated by the exercise of social function, broaden official conceptualizations about heritage. The results obtained from this qualitative approach, multiple case-study, show shared elements in the pathways towards heritigization in the community-based museums studied: a collective, co-creative and co-authored character; the presence of values expressed in practical ethics; and mobility and coexistence between intimate, community and pluriversal scales.

AB  - Drawing on anthropologist Kathleen Stewart's description of the ordinary as an "animate circuit that conducts force and maps connections, routes and disjunctures," this article reads the representations of the fugitive potentials of the quotidian in Shillong-based artist Tarun Bhartiya's photomontage/postcard collection Niam/Faith/Hynniewtrep (2021). Focusing on Bhartiya's utilization of the technique of montage and the poetic juxtaposition of text and images, I consider the pluriversal narratives of pasts, presents and futures in his representations of the ordinary and the quotidian in a frontier/borderland space like Northeast India as a contribution to the nascent field of visual studies and the photographic archive in the region. This essay evaluates the significance of avant-garde visual practices, like those of Bhartiya's, in probing the minutiae of ordinary life and its fugitive and unpredictable potentialities.

AB  - The debate about place has long intersected with design studies. Our contribution to interdisciplinary design is to facilitate a dialogue between design and human geography. Grounded in Doreen Massey's conceptualisation of place as the interrelations of diverse powers, processes and practices, this paper combines ethnographic methods and examples into a succinct place-based methodology for design researchers. We argue that this interpretation of place can provide designers and design researchers with an approach to understanding the multiplicity of place to locate themselves and their work better. We maintain that taking place-based methodologies seriously can support design researchers working in transdisciplinary teams, help avoid the pitfalls of homogenising and solution-based outcomes, and make space for Indigenous voices, feminist fabulations and pluriversal futures.(c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this paper, we as the teachers and researchers of a course titled Global education development informed by theories of decoloniality, report on our analysis of our self-critical and constructive dialogue on the course design, its underlying assumptions, expectations, implementation, success and needs for improvement. We centered decoloniality from the beginning of the course, problematised binary-thinking and encouraged our students to look at issues within the field of development and education in pluriversal ways. Our gestures toward decolonial pedagogy in the course were complicated by our own entanglements with coloniality as well as structural factors such as the context of Finland, where the colonial past is seldom addressed. Despite these contradictions and challenges, we aspire to continue thinking through decoloniality to decenter the dominant liberal frameworks within global education development.

AB  - What are beautiful Indigenous communities? How are we as original communities good for each other and our planet? This article asserts that these kinds of questions undergird Indigenous research methodologies as more than research paradigms and as life-sustaining worldviews that produce research designs that engage processes of healing and helpfulness and that reflect Indigenous pluriversal realities. Anchored by Indigenous knowledge systems, Indigenous pluriversalities counter the ubiquity and pervasiveness of coloniality by presenting, on one hand, distinct experiences under coloniality and, on the other hand, creative anti-colonial and decolonial strategies to care for the many Indigenous worlds that constitute planetary life. Within the current global schematic designed to produce consumers, this article considers how Indigenous research as a field continues to make space for ideas of individual and collective responsibilities to emerge.

AB  - This Special Issue of the Journal of Scandinavian Cinema focuses on race and ethnicity in Nordic film and TV cultures. The decolonial turn has produced a global shift in the recognition of cinema's historical relationship to imperialism, colonialism and racism, and emphasized the urgency of dismantling structural inequalities through new modes of engagement with minoritized artists and theorists, as well as Indigenous epistemological frameworks and pluriversal approaches - including critical race theory and its specific applications in a Nordic context. Consequently, these articles consider representational politics alongside interrelated concerns on practitioner agency and production contexts addressing equality and access in the media industries of these countries. The depth and historical range of the collection speaks to the need for an ongoing, critically reflective dialogue on these topics, especially as they remain significantly underrepresented in the field of Nordic media studies.

T2  - REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL STUDIES

KW  - INTERNATIONAL-RELATIONS
KW  - IR
AB  - Both relationality and separateness are aspects of our everyday lives. How we engage these phenomena hinges on the particular existential assumptions that we take for granted. Within the discipline of International Relations (IR), both relationality and separateness have informed how global politics is studied and practiced. How states and their relations are conceived has, for instance, varied by the distinct degrees of privilege given to separation and interconnection: from notions of completely autonomous units like billiard balls to always emergent phenomena co-constituted through relations. The plurality of trajectories that inform this Special Issue illustrate how much broader the spectrum of relational engagement can be when we are cognisant of the impact of these existential assumptions on forms of life, knowing, and knowledge production in International Relations. By highlighting a spectrum of relational engagement, we raise important questions about the way the various knowledge frames in IR are acknowledged, legitimised, limited, and reproduced.

T2  - COMPARATIVE EDUCATION REVIEW
LA  - English
KW  - SPACE
AB  - As a project of state political and economic agendas, the schooling of Indigenous peoples has historically tended to reflect everyone else's values, standards, and objectives but our own. However, for Indigenous communities, education is part of an array of long-term self-determination strategies that serve Indigenous autonomy, which is undergirded by Indigenous knowledge systems that encompass the political, economic, environmental, health, social, and cultural lives of Indigenous communities. Accordingly, Indigenous education in its many designs is founded in Indigenous struggles for interlinking forms and realizations of justice that recognize environmental dignity as indivisible from human life. Furthermore, the philosophies and enactments that sustain Indigenous autonomy in one place are never removed from other Indigenous places and the efforts of their people. This bridging across Indigenous worlds and our distinct and collective decolonial and interepistemic meanings of education constitute comparative Indigenous education, which is the focus of this themed issue.

The two regions are reciprocally holographical of each other. The latter part of the article will further propose a research agenda of post-Asianness. I hope to convey a message that is hidden but strong: that East Asia is a redundant agenda and yet fungible at the same time. This ontological irony can be likewise applied to both Chineseness and Asianness. Ultimately, China, East Asia and Asia are mainly strategic agendas and identities. The critical reflections outlined in this article are intended to display, facilitate and complicate the pluriversality of all post-identities.

AB  - The article reviews three entry points into a discussion of alternatives to today's neoliberal capitalism. The first examines the need for a green new deal from mostly UK-based think tanks positioning the household as central to the economy, posing new core values for the economy that respect the environment, the social economy as well as the possibilities offered by Web-based technologies for new economic and political community relations. The second entry point is a review of feminists' search for alternatives to mainstream economics and global development processes with calls for a transition to place-based socio-economic practices built on the ethics of care, gender justice, the centrality of social reproduction and community livelihoods. The last section examines the alternatives to global development and neoliberal capitalism emerging from Latin America examining Buen Vivir, intercultural pluriversal political and economic practices and lessons from Latin American indigenous women and decolonial feminist movements.

The fieldwork consisted of thematization of dances from Afro-Brazilian cultural matrices over two academic years with classes from two last years of elementary school in a public school. The data produced were subjected to cultural analysis, causing crossroads to emerge, mobilized in the intersection of the assumptions of the cultural curriculum of Physical Education, decolonial studies and pedagogy of crossroads. Based on frontier thinking materialized in the rejection of a unique way of reading reality, in epistemic disobedience, announced by a pluriversal perspective found in the performativities of students, evidenced in epistemological crosses, rollers and ebos, which enables the aspiration of an exuistic epistemology observed in the resignification of gestures, in organized experiences, emerging in the cracks, transgressions, erasures, becomings, uncertainties, mobilities, rebellions, syncopations, giving rise to possibilities of becoming and existing, opening up other paths and new crossroads.

I argue that both assert or aspire for other ways of being and belonging to the world and open possibilities for post-capitalist futures. In this Commentary, I focus on ontological continuities between the two movements and the grounds for alliance building. I argue that EJ and degrowth movements need to not only learn from each other, but think with the actual practices on the ground and the epistemologies of the South to foster pluriversal world-making practices. Moreover, dialogues and alliance between the two movements can help to reconceptualize work and care in a post-production, post-growth world.

AB  - Decolonising the curriculum is a global imperative that takes different forms and urgency depending on the context. Developments across the globe such as BlackLivesMatter and student responses to the pandemic and online learning have raised new questions about the curriculum - critically questioning higher education institutions' plans about not only providing access to resources but about the (cultural) authority of curricula, pedagogical and research practices that are still dominated by Western discourses. This paper examines three experiences of curriculum decolonisation in cultural policy and management, an applied subject that has culture as its object, in three different contexts, Serbia, Puerto Rico and South Africa: namely how the pursuit of a pluriversal knowledge ecology found expression in the curriculum, content and pedagogical practices deployed to deliver locally relevant education; and how educators resolved the ontological and epistemic discontinuities between the standard disciplinary canon and local realities to embed and contextualise the discipline.

AB  - This article discusses religious transitions and border making in Southeast Brazil. The study is based on 11 months of ethnographic fieldwork in Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo (2011-2015). The article navigates the Southeast Brazilian cross-religious spiritual landscape, shedding light on the knowledges and experiences of Umbanda and Candomble leaders, devotees and clients, as well as my own experiences as a researcher crossing through different religious environments. The research results show that besides institutions and identities, the religious lines of association emerge via acknowledgement of spatial/territorial engagements with humans and other-than-humans (spirits, entities, orixas, egums). The study argues that beyond the conventional conceptualization of syncretism and hybridism, the concept of the encruzilhada (crossroads) allows a deeper understanding of the unexpected range of phenomena and ongoing transit, exchange and mutual influence in the epistemologically pluriversal spiritual landscape of Southeast Brazil.

AB  - In this article, we offer a description of and reflection on our 2019 'creating alternate worlds' course as a model for critical making in twenty-first-century higher education. Open to arts and humanities undergraduate students interested in creative research, our course used world building as a central approach to imagining alternatives. We found that explicitly centring Black and Indigenous perspectives helped support non-dominant students in their striving to realize possibilities beyond settler colonial visions of the future. We share our position in relation to decolonization and decolonizing pedagogies before describing the course at a high level and through an in-depth case study of an author's research project. Our analysis of the course is presented via three axiological allegiances and three performative pragmatics. By discussing our political stance and a conceptual innovation that we term, 'transcosmic potentials', we conclude with insights for fellow educators. This pluriversal learning community opened a multiplicity of 'portals' to heterogeneous worlds, each with the power to fundamentally and forever alter all who pass through.

AB  - Critics have faulted the project of general psychology for conceptions of general truth that (1) emphasize basic processes abstracted from context and (2) rest on a narrow foundation of research among people in enclaves of Eurocentric modernity. Informed by these critiques, we propose decolonial perspectives as a new scholarly imaginary for general psychology Otherwise. Whereas hegemonic articulations of general psychology tend to ignore life in majority-world communities as something peripheral to its knowledge project, decolonial perspectives regard these communities as a privileged site for general understanding. Indeed, the epistemic standpoint of such communities is especially useful for understanding the coloniality inherent in modern individualist lifeways and the fundamental relationality of human existence. Similarly, whereas hegemonic articulations of general psychology tend to impose particular Eurocentric forms masquerading as general laws, the decolonial vision for general psychology Otherwise exchanges the universalized particular for a more pluralistic (or pluriversal) general.

AB  - The post-development school associated with the thought of Arturo Escobar treats development as a discursive invention of the West, best countered by ethnographic attention to local knowledge of people marginalised by colonial modernity. This approach promises paths to more equitable and sustainable alternatives to development. Post-development has been criticised vigorously in the past. But despite its conceptual and political shortcomings, it remains the most popular critical approach to development and is reemerging in decolonial and pluriversal guises. This paper contends that the post-development critique of mainstream development has run its course and deserves a fresh round of criticism. We argue that those committed to struggles for social justice must critically reassess the premises of post-development and especially wrestle with the problem of representation. We contend that Gayatri Spivak's work is particularly important to this project. We review some of Spivak's key texts on capitalism, difference, and development to clarify the virtues of her approach.

AB  - In this commentary, I point out that Buscher and other critics of the nonhuman turn ignore insights offered by Feminist, Black and Indigenous scholarship that help rethink the human and alternate worldmaking possibilities. The healthy corrective to the somewhat apolitical celebration of liveliness and entanglements in Western new materialist and posthumanism literature, that Buscher and others seek, already exists in Feminist, Black and Indigenous scholarship and practices, and in activism for environmental and climate justice around the world. In these times of deep ecological crises and precarity, we would do well to turn to the wisdom of Indigenous Peoples and other land-based cultures that embody and live by some of the central propositions of the "nonhuman turn". I argue that the central propositions of nonhuman turn - relationality and interdependence; decentering and rethinking the human; honouring the agency, intelligence and subjecthood of other beings - offer alternate ways of doing politics and of imagining and enacting pluriversal, postcapitalist worlds. If this is not grounds for radical ecopolitics, then what is?

AB  - This study explores how translanguaging has been enacted in a university-wide curriculum transformation project in an additional language programme in Aotearoa New Zealand. Its aim is to reveal students' perspectives on integrating Indigenous epistemology into the curriculum of a beginner-level Chinese course. The survey data, collected from 155 students, show that most students react positively to the idea of embedding Indigenous epistemology into language teaching through a translanguaging assessment design. Moreover, students' translingual practices in their digital multimodal compositions demonstrate that they can enact translanguaging to enable the coexistence of different bodies of knowledge while learning an additional language. Based on these findings, I suggest that language teaching should integrate place-based worldviews that are meaningful to all local students. It is also important to adopt translanguaging as a decolonising approach to facilitate a pluriversal epistemological stance that promotes plurilingualism in language education. The nexus between translanguaging and decoloniality needs to be explored further, as does the possibility for cross-civilisational learning through translanguaging.

AB  - Drawing upon the decolonial theorizing from Latin America, this article examines the odd trajectory of globalization of the bottom-of-pyramid (BoP) approach. Rather than a future-oriented cosmopolitan business design aimed to overcome poverty challenges in the developing world, this article shows that the BoP approach rearticulates, within an era of neoliberal capitalism, the rhetoric of salvation and progress, which was inaugurated by the darker side of modernity over five centuries ago with the discovery/conquest of America. Analysis shows that the BoP approach has evolved through underinvestigated interplay involving the market-oriented and the warfare-oriented facets of US-led neoliberalism and the radicalization of the longue duree of asymmetric dynamics involving decoloniality, hybridisms, and the darker sides of modernity. The authors argue that the globalization of the BoP approach in emerging economies embodies not only the radicalization of global coloniality but also a potential transition toward a pluriversal world in which many worlds, knowledges, and histories could coexist.

AB  - Scholarly engagement with ethics, epistemologies and positionalities dilemmas in conflict research is marked by a disconnect between self-referential debates in the Ivory Tower and the very places research takes place. If there is reflection on foreign researchers, research brokers or research participants, accounts of genuinely collaborative work are rare. Drawing from a decade of collaborative research in eastern Congo, our essay targets this gap by critically discussing challenges we faced and lessons we learned with regards to our mutual positionalities. In so doing, we join debates calling for situated reflection on ethnography in and of conflict zones. Based on our research experience, we contend that a fully joint approach - including planning, execution, analysis and writing - can be an avenue toward decolonizing our ethics and epistemologies. Moreover, we argue for a pluriversal ethics that accounts for context and positionalities of the involved researchers and allows for collaborative worldmaking.

AB  - This essay is an attempt to come to terms with the Young Lords' popular liberation rhetoric in the church offensive. Building from Michael Calvin McGee's observation that "'the people' are more process than phenomenon,'' I explore the ways in which the Young Lords' craft "the people's repertory of convictions'' from diverse rhetorical resources in their verbal, visual, and embodied discourse surrounding the church offensive. In highlighting such a performative repertoire for "the people,'' I extend research related to ideographs by articulating a link between ideographs and what Charles Taylor and others call the "social imaginary,'' which is "not a set of ideas; rather it is what enables, through making sense of, the practices of society.'' In making this connection between ideographs and social imaginaries, I read the Young Lords' rhetoric of "the people'' as a radical, decolonial challenge to the modern social imaginary. Specifically, I argue that the Young Lords' rearticulation of "the people'' as a pluriversal collective, demanding material and epistemological liberation, delinks and denaturalizes hegemonic constructions of a liberal/Western "people'' that "totalize A reality'' in the modern social imaginary.

AB  - This article analyses important trends in contemporary decolonial approaches in the field of international studies and, drawing on recent work in critical Black studies, seeks to highlight some of the limitations in their assumptions. Anthropologically informed decolonial approaches argue for a pluriversal approach, where multiple 'worlds' can coexist, whilst sociologically grounded critiques seek to develop the field of international studies through adding social and historical depth to our understanding of power and challenging racial hierarchies. Both these forms of decolonial argument aim to pluralise and expand understandings, drawing in marginalised and excluded outsiders, in a bid to repair and revitalise international studies. However, we argue that a third approach, starting from the assumption of an antiblack world, raises important questions for decolonial study. Drawing from critical Black studies, we suggest that the dominant forms of decolonial critique may not adequately address the liberal modernist assumptions underpinning the field of international study. If another decolonial approach is possible it will bring a disruptive and deconstructive perspective, one that seeks to avoid inadvertently strengthening the antiblack foundations of the field.

KW  - Pluriverse
KW  - Relational Cosmology
AB  - There is a multifaceted relational revolution afoot in International Relations (IR) and in the social sciences more widely. This article suggests, via engagement with varied forms of relational thought and practice in IR, but in particular via engagement with 'relational cosmology' associated with the 'natural' as well as the 'social' sciences, that there are important reasons for relational thought and practice in IR and around it to be more attentive to dialogues on relationality across natural and social sciences. If relational thought in IR has challenged the colonial and bifurcated ontologies of the field, relational cosmology too assists in shifting 'modern' understandings of science and the cosmos by facilitating engagement with situated knowledges and deep-going relationalities across 'nature' and 'society', 'human' and 'non-human' communities. Relational cosmology may be productive in joining, and perhaps even in facilitating, conversations across multiple relationalities emerging from different parts of the world and in different fields of inquiry, and yet - reflecting its relational and pluriversal orientations - it is not proposed here as a new 'meta-' or 'grand-' narrative for relational theorising or IR.

KW  - WORLD
AB  - Decolonial theory offers sociologists, especially critical race scholars, powerful theoretical and methodological tools to understand historical and contemporary injustice and resistance. As a revolutionary epistemology, decolonial theory and methods feature critical insights into knowledges from subaltern voices concerned with how the implementation of modern technologies shape colonial structures, inequalities, the daily lives of the colonized, and resistance strategies. However, decolonial studies have long been the purview of the humanities and remain marginal to the social sciences due, partially, to a dearth of foundational theorizing. Challenging scientific colonialism, historicism, and Eurocentric conceptions of civilization while simultaneously linking these phenomena to racialized exploitation of labor within a modern global capitalist system and resistance to it, W. E. B. Du Bois's sociological theories, methods, and advocacy offer insightful ways to begin decolonizing the discipline, theoretically and in practice, in scholarship and in the world. This article outlines Du Bois's theoretical and empirical contributions by putting him in dialogue with a century of decolonial scholarship before offering suggestions for how to mobilize Du Bois's decolonial theory and methods for a pluriversal decolonial sociology.

AB  - Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela, charismatic and iconic, is a product of his time and can only be understood within the context of the social movements that he belonged to and led. Thus, this article locates Mandela within the local and global context in which he emerged while at the same time making sense of his instrumental interventions and nationalist humanist vision of life, peace and justice. This article situates Mandela's political life within the broader context of the third humanist revolution, which was a response to the inimical processes of racism, enslavement and colonisation. In its centenary celebration of Mandela, the article re-articulates how he embodied alternative politics founded on the will to live as opposed to the will to power; the paradigm of peace as opposed to the paradigm of war; political justice as opposed to criminal justice; as well as pluriversality as opposed to tragic notions of racial separate development known as apartheid. What is fleshed out is a 'Mandela phenomenon' as founded on strong progressive politics albeit predicated on the unstable idea of the potential of advocates and victims of apartheid undergoing a radical metamorphosis amenable to the birth of a new pluriversal society.

AB  - The article examines voice and voicing in translation processes in music, using on the one hand the example of Miriam Makeba, and on the other hand, features of African choir, in order to develop a broader argument about the musical and political significance of the multivalence of voice. The article begins with a re-valuation of some of the contributions of Miriam Makeba and their relevance to contemporary concerns of the twenty-first century, specifically to societies such as South Africa. It reflects on some of the salient revelations in her autobiography as well as on her music, her style and her politics. I argue that Makeba deployed voice as a sophisticated vehicle of translation with a vision of multivalent and plural futures. In the final section of the article, I reflect on my own artistic involvements and experiments using choir, both in translating African choral traditions to contemporary European performance contexts, as well as in the African repurposing of Western choral elements. My interest in voice and embodied translation is not merely technical, but reflects a political concern and vision, which at its core, strives towards a recalibration and reconstitution of concepts of Africanity, not as rigid and exclusionary, but rather as multi-valent and pluriversal.

AB  - All designing, as well as everything designed, is ontological: things shape and form humans, just as humans shape and give form to them (Willis, 2006, Fry, 2013). However, there is no ontology of the human in the singular sense, but plural, multiple ontologies, and therefore, no human, but only humans. This paper proposes the introduction of a provocation to disturb notions of the ontologically designed body, and in fact, of how we think of what a `body' is, by turning to the insights offered up by a body of literature hitherto relatively unexamined in design research: the ontological turn in anthropology. By turning to a survey of the work done by cultural anthropologists on different cosmologies and cultures, I intend to demonstrate that the Anglo-Eurocentric conception of the ontologically singular body, signified in terms of the "universality" of human biology, is in fact, only one of many ways of bodily being and relating to the body; that matters of the body are locally situated and specific to communities and environments; and therefore, what we mean by `the body' is in fact also plural, multistable, and wrought with incommensurabilities between human communities and cultures. The essay will end with a re-evaluation of ontological designing and speculations on what design could do, through an engagement with examples of `other' ontologies and definitions of body.

TI  - Max Lifchitz: A Transmodern Composer in American Music?
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN MUSIC
LA  - English
AB  - Latin American and Latinx composers continue to contribute to music by bringing a subtle universe of sounds shaped by their agency and cultural history. Composer Max Lifchitz (b. 1948) bridges his artistic output with entrepreneurship and pedagogy. Since migrating from Mexico to the United States, Lifchitz has constructed a multifaceted persona as a cultural broker. As a composer, Lifchitz's self-defined eclecticism forms the basis of his musical voice, which reconciles opposites and flows between contrasting compositional aesthetics, cultures, and techniques. In 1980, he created the North/South Consonance organization, which has been an open and anti-canonical space for composers from different aesthetics, traditions, and ethnic and gender identities to share their works with new music audiences. In Lifchitz's role as a pedagogue, he positions music as a pluriversal tool to generate epistemological equity and inclusion and a more intercultural educational experience. Despite his contributions to contemporary Western art music, his impact on new music has not yet been studied. Therefore, the article's purpose is to examine Lifchitz's extensive and complex contributions from a transmodern theoretical perspective as postulated by philosopher Enrique Dussel (b. 1934) to demonstrate how the composer's music and persona represent qualities of this philosophical theory and promote the redefinition of art music and the musician's role in the twenty-first century.

AB  - This article explores the potential of poetry for attuning to and expressing resonance in multi-sensory geographies. I argue that poetic inquiry can provide novel ways to address sensory geographies, by shifting the focus from individual senses to a more integrated understanding of how sensory phenomena resonates across bodies and spaces. By doing this, poetry also becomes a resonant method that allows one to merge different subjectivities and express pluriversal worlds. I draw upon Erlmann's discussion of resonance as a way to overcome three dichotomies regarding knowing and the senses that have been recently contested in sensory geographies, namely the dichotomies between reasoning and the affective, the external and internal, and attention and distraction. In order to demonstrate the potential of poetry as a resonant method, I present a poetic exploration of the life of the Staines Reservoirs. The findings of this experiment show that poetry can be a resonant method when the geographer-poet is attuned to the way in which thinking and feeling are intertwined, the ways in which the senses mix themselves in the experience of the world, and the ways in which the world resonates within bodies and bodies echo in the world.

AB  - Undertaking participatory work with Indigenous people requires a reflexive and critical reimagining of how non-Indigenous design researchers engage with place. This paper draws upon reflexive learnings from a co-design education programme with young adults from Ntaria, Western Arrarnta Country in the Central Desert of Australia. Co-designing with Ntaria youth involved deeper questioning of the dynamics of participation, catalysing a change of pace and a shift from engaging as a Design Researcher and Educator to a person open to different ways of relating. This embodied transformation required leaning into uncertainty and discomfort as a new practice of waiting and becoming relational, attuned to the temporal rhythms of people and 'Country'. While the stories are highly personal and contextually specific, the paper aims to inspire others to reflect and question alternative ways of being a design researcher. By shifting away from de-personalised accounts of research that emphasises roles, skills, processes, and methodologies, this paper reimagines co-design as co-ontological ways of becoming, which troubles research traditions of replicability and generalisability. For co-design to be reimagined this way, we argue the significance of onto-epistemes that are beyond dominant research orthodoxies to respect and embrace pluriversal ways of participating, learning, and teaching design.

AB  - In the reinscribing of white supremacy in the United States, the contemporary university as a place of exclusion presents a problem of religion. Approaching religion as "the search for depth" and addressing the "techno-myths" of betterment, longevity, and the rituals of enacting these myths that capture today's social imaginaries, this paper proposes an alternative to religious faith in "rising" and the rhetoric of the contemporary American technocratic-meritrocratic paradigm. Adopting the posthumanist methodologies of reflexivity and diffraction, the author argues for an embodied catholicity of the university as a community, an open system rather than a pre-formed locus to which racially minoritized students are "added" or "included". In advancing the co-creativity of a Catholic-pluriversal university via an ethic of love and care, the author presents a Christian spirituality that is itself a technology that offers the hope of enacting a more life-giving congruence between the sacred and the secular than the myth of Manifest Destiny and the racialized violence that is the continued manifestation of that mythos. Embodied in the posthuman mystic's practices of "re-memory," the author presents Christianity as a performative-pluralistic religion of evolution, one of common action with the potential to draw into something new the energies of creativity in today's university.

AB  - The debates on the sustainability of development have a long history. Although the Brundtland Report popularized "sustainable development", this slippery concept sidelined previous critiques of development and has been compatible with a wide range of conflicting agendas. A notable example of this contradiction is the uncritical promotion of capitalist growth in the pursuit of social justice and ecosystem health by the sustainable development goals. In contrast to this reliance on the "one world" of Euroamerican market economies, this special feature presents 12 case studies of "alternatives to sustainable development". These case studies question the anthropocentric universalism of the development project and enact radically different relational ontologies, often gathered under the conceptual umbrella of the "pluriverse". They focus on territorial, community, and network initiatives that intend to move methodologically beyond discourse analysis with a situated and empirical analysis of how pluriversal practices might flourish as well as generate tensions. We identify three frictions with capitalist modernity emerging from these contributions: (1) how alternatives to sustainable development relate to state institutions, (2) how they engage with the distribution of surplus, and (3) how they unsettle scientific epistemologies, at times regenerating past resources-and at other times radical futures. With this special feature, we hope to re-politicize the debates on the science and practice of sustainability, and weave the contributions of anticolonial and indigenous science studies into neo-Marxist and post-development critiques.

AB  - This special issue (SI) editorial contributes to ongoing efforts worldwide to decolonise management and organisational knowledge (MOK). A robust pluriversal discussion on the how and why of decolonisation is vital. Yet to date, most business and management schools are on the periphery of debates about decolonising higher education, even as Business Schools in diverse locations function as contested sites of neocolonialism and expansion of Western neoliberal perspectives. This editorial and special issue is the outcome of a unique set of relationships and processes that saw Organization host its first paper development workshop in Africa in 2019. This editorial speaks to a radical ontological plurality that up-ends the classical division between theory and praxis. It advocates praxistical theorising that moves beyond this binary and embraces decolonising knowledge by moving into the realm of affect and embodied, other-oriented reflexive, communicative praxis. It underscores the simultaneous, contested and unfinished decolonising-recolonising doubleness of praxis and the potential of borderlands locations to work with these dynamics. This special issue brings together a set of papers which advance different decolonising projects and grapple with the nuances of what it means to 'do' decolonising in a diversity of empirical and epistemic settings.

TI  - Worlds More or Less: Nineteenth-Century Ethno-Astronomy and Cosmologies of Reference
T2  - EUROPEAN ROMANTIC REVIEW
LA  - English
AB  - This essay reads William Herschel's nebular hypothesis (and the debates it galvanized) in light of Sylvia Wynter's account of the cosmology of Man. Tracing the relationship between Western monohumanism and "ethno-astronomy," Wynter demonstrates how the post-Copernican worldview posited Earth as materially contiguous with the heavens and only one sphere among many. If, as Wynter argues, this rupture facilitated the transhistorical absolutization of Man as the human, the question of form is key to this history. For, insofar as the form of the sphere differentiates world-making Man from merely world-inhabiting Others (both human and nonhuman), it subtends British colonial schemas of empire and race. Nineteenth-century writings about nebulae are curious in this context for how they figure beyond the ethno-astronomy of Man. In attempting to formalize nebulae-gossamer celestial objects that possess no outline-thinkers from Thomas De Quincey to John Pringle Nichol glimpse a cosmos that discomposes the contiguities of both matter and reference upon which the colonial liberal subject's cosmology of whiteness depends. This becomes especially apparent as nebulae turn the workings of analogy haywire. Pushed to the point of failure, analogy inadvertently discerns and asserts a world whose pluriversal configurations of human and nonhuman might inform anti- and decolonial projects.

AB  - Bridging critical heritage studies with insurgent planning theory, this article proposes the notion of 'insurgent heritage' to discuss heritage preservation's role in constructing urban citizenship in Latin America. Critical heritage scholars have pointed to the European dominant heritage discourse deployed worldwide that excludes subordinated voices in the production of heritage. The research has also illuminated alternative understandings of preservation that sit outside of or opposed to the state and the cultural elites' concept of what should or should not be preserved. My use of insurgent heritage adds another layer of nuance to this body of work. It promotes a pluriversal perspective by building on Southern urbanisms, Latin American social collective action, and feminist scholarship. Inspired by ethnographic work with heritage grassroots organizations in Chile, this line of argument shows that communities' local knowledge pushes against the practice of heritage preservation and planning by only sanctioned experts. Instead, by transgressing false dichotomies of informal and formal arenas of politics, insurgent heritage proposes multiple perspectives to envision alternative futures. It reframes grassroots heritage as a sociocultural process mediated by the interplay of memory-work and the specifics of place as an ethical form of place-based care that highlights the cultural dimension of citizenship.

AB  - Current discussion on coloniality dismantles structures embedded in neoliberal capitalism that maintain and perpetuate social pathologies. Theories and praxes emerging from Abya Yala (North, Central, and South America) provide academic and nonacademic contributions to co-construct community psychologies de otra manera (otherwise). These accountable ways of knowing and acting in cultural context and local place, become ways of making counterculture to inform decolonial community psychologies. The epistemologies of the Global South have produced invaluable teachings for transformative revisions of community psychology within frameworks that go beyond liberation and toward decoloniality. Activist women and decolonial feminists from the Global South, contest patriarchal rationality and universalism and co-construct new ways of being, thinking-feeling, sentipensar, and acting. Decolonial paradigms weave networks of solidarity with communities in their struggles to sustain Indigenous cosmovisions, delinking from western-centric ideologies that are not anthropocentric and promote sustainability, epistemic and ecological justice, and Sumak Kawsay/Buen Vivir (wellbeing) that includes the rights of the Earth. This paper deepens into decolonial community psychologies from Abya Yala that are making the road caminando (walking) de otra manera by applying methodologies of affective conviviality with communities, sentipensando, and co-authoring collective stories that weave pluriversal solidary networks within ecologies of praxes into colorful tapestries of liberation. These are the proposed coordinates to sketch pathways toward decoloniality.

KW  - Global South
AB  - This paper seeks to initiate a conversation between degrowth (DG) and postdevelopment (PD) frameworks by placing them within the larger field of discourses for ecological and civilizational transitions and by bridging proposals emerging from the North with those from the Global South. Not only can this dialogue, it is argued, be mutually enriching for both movements but perhaps essential for an effective politics of transformation. Part I of the paper presents a brief panorama of transition discourses (TDs), particularly in the North. Part II discusses succinctly the main postdevelopment trends in Latin America, including Buen Vivir (BV), the rights of Nature, civilizational crisis, and the concept of 'alternatives to development'. With these elements in hand, Part III attempts a preliminary dialogue between degrowth and postdevelopment, identifying points of convergence and tension; whereas they originate in somewhat different intellectual traditions and operate through different epistemic and political practices, they share closely connected imaginaries, goals, and predicaments, chiefly, a radical questioning of the core assumption of growth and economism, a vision of alternative worlds based on ecological integrity and social justice, and the ever present risk of cooptation. Important tensions remain, for instance, around the critique of modernity and the scope for dematerialization. This part ends by outlining areas of research on PD that could be of particular interest to degrowth scholars. The conclusion, finally, envisions the dissolution of the very binary of 'Global North' and 'Global South' by adopting a pluriversal perspective.

AB  - Whether addressing violent ethno-nationalism, xenophobic bigotry, or religious intolerance, scholars and educators invoke cosmopolitan notions of a shared planet and common humanity as a means of rising above difference. Cosmopolitanism as an ethical and political orientation places an imperative on seeking out, welcoming, and learning from cultural others. As such, cosmopolitanism involves a process of reducing the social and physical proximity between 'them' and 'us' carried out in the belief in shared commonalities held by a universal 'we.' However, a priori assumptions about who and what constitutes that 'we' at the heart of cosmopolitanism are necessarily partial, situated, and subjective. In this special section, authors consider the tensions, paradoxes, and potentials of cosmopolitanism in diverse settings and from diverse perspectives. Specifically, these papers examine the formation of youthful, cosmopolitan subjectivities and youth involvement in the creation of cosmopolitan spaces, from South-South global volunteering and international missionary trips to the anti-nationalist hip-hop scene in Sarajevo and efforts to enact a civic cosmopolitanism in Beirut. Situated in post-colonial and post-conflict contexts and centering the political subjectivities of young people and their hopeful efforts to bring about a better world, these papers examine the spatial-temporal politics of cosmopolitanism and the tension inherent in creating necessarily bounded spaces grounded in cosmopolitan openness. This introduction frames this examination of grounded and contested cosmopolitanisms as an immanent process of world-building guided by a transcendent worldviews. This framing emphasizes cosmopolitanism as a universal moral outlook and the need to create caring pluriversal worlds capable of accommodating multiple worldviews.

AB  - Concepts in science education such as "science identity" and "science capital" are informed by dominant epistemological and ontological positions, which translate into assumptions about what counts as science and whose science counts. In this theoretical paper we draw on decolonial and antiracist perspectives to examine these assumptions in light of the heterogeneous onto-epistemological and axiological values, cultural perspectives, and contributions of nondominant groups, and specifically of those who have been historically marginalized based on their gender, race, ethnic, age, and/or social class identity. Building on these arguments, we critique deficit-based approaches to science teaching, learning, and research, including those that focus on systemic injustice, yet leave intact dominant framings of the scientific enterprise, which are exclusionary and meritocratic. As an alternative, we offer a design of science teaching and learning for the pluriverse-"a world where many worlds fit". This alternative allows us to reconstruct science and science-related "outcomes," such as identity, in the service of cultural, epistemic, and linguistic pluralism. We close the paper with the idea that because mainstream theories reproduce deficit framings and educational injustices, we must engage with decolonial(1) theories of pluriversality and discuss different onto-epistemologies to be able to grapple with existing social, racial, environmental injustices, and land-based devastations.

AB  - In this article, human-computer interaction (HCI) is explored as a design-oriented practice nurturing the becoming of what is not-yet in future-oriented and speculative manners. Such approaches have evolved over time and now the field seems ready to take leaps targeting social and culturally infused contexts, such as those suggested by critical design, design things, adversarial design, making futures, pluriversal design and critical fabulations. It is in this respect that feminist theories, methods and imaginaries are rendered important. Feminist theory is in this article considered an important companion and part of the practical tool-kit necessary for generative, speculative and ethical approaches within the field of HCI. How to think with care is explored as a meta-design strategy directed and informed by feminist onto-epistemologies - a strategy intended to 'seed' speculative and social justice-oriented design endeavours through generative figurations and critical dilemmas to foster abilities and sensibilities for dealing with difference differently. What is advanced is the need for meta-design space in HCI, in this article referred to as a contact zone, a feminist figuration with the intention to open up for design explorations with ethical imperatives. Four other interrelated feminist figurations are also loosely explored in order to frame how thinking with care in HCI could be advanced further, i.e. diffractive thinking, intra-activism, becoming-with and response-ability. By considering serious feminist accounts of situated knowledges and touching visions, it is argued that feminist thinking is well on its way to offering real alternatives of great importance for HCI.

AB  - At a time of ecological emergency there are pressing reasons to develop more responsive wellbeing-led governance frameworks that engage with both human and more-than-human wellbeing. Attempts to incorporate wellbeing indices into wellbeing-led governance include the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations, the Gross National Happiness index of Bhutan, and a variety of emerging wellbeing-led governance frameworks in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Some of these frameworks have begun to include more-than-human wellbeing indices in their toolkit, but like many geographers and Indigenous scholars, we are wary of the dangers of universalising and abstractionist Indexology' (Ratuva, 2016). In this paper, we review wellbeing-led governance frameworks with a view to more-than-human wellbeing and Indigenous knowledge. We outline an emerging pluriversal and prefigurative project where Indigenous scholars engage with partners in co-creation methods in place, incorporating Indigenous-Maori cultural perspectives into more situated and holistic wellbeing tools. We argue that while critique is important, so too is engaging in Indigenous-led research interventions for transformative metrics and tools, particularlyin these times of socio-ecological crisis. As we 'stay with' this trouble (Haraway, 2018), we hope to contribute to a culturally specific place-based set of wellbeing indices and tools to inform wellbeing-led governance for more-than-human wellbeing.

AB  - The struggles for decolonisation involve problems of coloniality of knowledge that persist in postcolonial states and shape their national educational programmes. In Ecuador, the request to decolonise education has been part of the agenda of Indigenous organisations for decades, and has successfully led to the formulation of programmes of intercultural bilingual education. In its radical acception, intercultural education theoretically aims to represent and revitalise knowledges and languages that have been for long under processes of invisibility and erasure. Moreover, the offer of culturally pertinent education would shorten the epistemic distance that plays a role in the access and retention of Indigenous students, especially in higher education. In line with these principles, this study analyses the situation of higher education programmes in the Amazonia region, with a focus on the Universidad Estatal Amazonica (UEA), who claims to integrate ancestral knowledges in its study programmes. The research aims to see how the study contents and pedagogical approaches respect the pluriversal worlds of the Amazonian region. Using official reports, observations and interviews, the study reveals, on the one hand, a persistence of approaches that deny the validity of intercultural education, and on the other hand, a growing presence of decolonial spaces claimed by the students as a reaction to the coloniality of knowledge within the UEA.

AB  - This article adopts a decolonial lens to explore leading Chicana feminist writer Gloria Anzaldua's aesthetics as an attempt to de-other and expand the field of Chicana literature, which receives less academic attention in Taiwan than other minority discourses. The article argues that the strangeness in Anzaldua's writings, which resist straightforward attempts to decipher them, results from the double nature of her endeavor. On the one hand, Anzaldua decolonizes aesthetics by liberating non-rational sensibilities suppressed by the rational mind to broaden the scope of what counts as reality. On the other hand, she aestheticizes decoloniality by deploying experimental storytelling strategies to offer new languages for those residing in the cracks of the normative to narrate their subjectivities. Through this double movement, Anzaldua's decolonial aesthetics de-others those considered to be outcast, lesser, or alien, so we might recognize their ontological co-existence with us and the pluriversal world we live in. For Anzaldua, the praxis of de-othering is not about familiarizing those marked as the other within an existing frame of meaning. Instead, as this article will show, to de-other is to desire an otherwise realm that opens up an alternative space-time where the multiplicity that the marginalized preserve and embody can be affirmed and appreciated.

AB  - Facing the intertwined environmental, social and economic crisis requires us to seriously consider alternatives to the current capitalist system, including the emerging concept of degrowth. Existing understandings of degrowth have focused on characterizing the shape, the key elements and the proposals for a degrowth society. However, its dynamic and evolving nature as an alternative vision of the future, and the dynamics of a transition toward degrowth are inadequately considered. This paper seeks to address this conceptual gap through a re-conceptualisation of degrowth as a radical niche innovation to the capitalist-growth regime. By extending the multi-level perspective framework to the capitalist-growth system, we undertake a critical reconsideration of the multi-level perspective, exposing key assumptions of this framework grounded in capitalist economic theory. Through this, we propose a Pluriversal potential pathway for change. To consider this further, a bibliometric analysis is used to measure and visualize research activity in degrowth as a proxy for the processes of development of the degrowth niche. Then, we return to the multi-level perspective to consider two potential pathways for change involving the degrowth niche and the capitalist-growth regime. Finally, we point to areas for further research that build on this new conceptualisation of a degrowth transition.

AB  - Research in water governance and management is a complex subject that involves the appraisal of social, economic, and environmental-biophysical aspects. Cultural and social values are regarded as key drivers in decision-making processes in both domains. Identifying relevant cultural values however is difficult given the interdisciplinary nature of theoretical frameworks and the implementation and operational needs of water governance/management research. In this work, we conduct a systematic literature review and thematic analysis of existing theories of culture (ToC) to identify common cultural values, theoretical frameworks, disciplinary trajectories and implementation trends relevant to water management and governance. Results indicate that the dominant ToC corresponds to Cultural Theory with its four defined categories (Egalitarian-Hierarchist-Individualist-Fatalist). In addition, results show emergent cultural values linked to "local" place-based knowledge perspectives indicating a more pluriversal understanding of cultural values. Cultural values associated with water management revolve around anthropocentrism, whereas values associated with water governance revolve around concepts of provenance/places. Implementation of ToC/cultural values is limited in practical applications, and we provide an example on how to improve on that. We suggest a succinct theory of culture such as Schwartz's cultural values be considered to be an alternative to capture a greater heterogeneity across the breadth of water governance/management-related and basin-specific contexts.

AB  - Feminists across a variety of contexts have written extensively about womanhood. Recently the question of difference-to account for the cultural, ethnic and racial diversity among women themselves-has become a highly contested issue in feminist theories. Tensions have ensued where "western feminisms" have been criticised for bias that is embedded in the objectification of "different" women regarded as "other" as "traditional" and therefore inferior. Several African feminists have also questioned "western" concepts such as gender and their relevance to the African context. Womanhood-a set of socially defined attributes appropriate for women-holds different meanings depending on the context in which it is defined. Drawing on decolonial African feminist approaches, this qualitative study aimed to understand the meaning of "womanhood" from the perspectives of never-married women (methepa) in Lesotho, where womanhood is defined in terms of marriage. In-depth interviews were conducted with 20 methepa from various contexts in Lesotho. As opposed to the "traditional" definition that accounts for a single attribute-woman as "wife"-methepa defined "womanhood" in different ways. By foregrounding respectability, sexual empowerment, mothering and personhood, these women deconstructed binarised gendered categories. This paper builds on the indigenous and also draws from the indigenous for knowledge production. In so doing, it deconstructs metanarratives and reconfigures knowledges around women's sexualities, agency and "womanhoods" in Lesotho, as a contribution to pluriversal knowledge production.

AB  - This article discusses death, mourning and decolonisation, focusing on the Selk'nam of Karokynka/Tierra del Fuego, Chile. Methodologically, it is grounded in feminist experiments of bringing creative and personalised writing into an academic scholarship to challenge subject/object-relations, and to generate platforms for affective, world-making intra-actions and undoings of power. Through collaborative efforts of three differently situated co-authors, using poetic epistolary forms of address, the article unfolds an indigenous centred, feminist, decolonial methodology. Along similar lines, the theoretical approach to death and mourning is pluriversal, transgressing Western epistemologies and ontologies. Through letters, addressed to dead and alive, human and non-human key actors in a revitalising of Selk'nam culture, the article questions ethico-politically in/appropriate ways of mourning the consequences of the necropolitics imposed on the Selk'nam through white colonisation, Western modernity and its colonial matrix of necropower. It is critically addressed how mourning the lost became embedded in colonial discourses of white melancholia and humanism. Moreover combining creative writing methodologies, inspired by feminism, posthumanism, and by indigenous activism and practices of reviving Selk'nam culture, the authors use their different locations to search affirmatively for ways of mourning, which open horizons towards decolonising, cultural revitalising, reclaiming of indigenous rights and philosophies of death and mourning.

KW  - suicide
AB  - From the Latin American modernity/coloniality project, we address the inhospitality of the modern/colonial and globally designed world-system in relation to suicidality. In our vernacular Spanglish, guided by epistemological disobedience, and responding to epistemicide, we interpellate ourselves to unmask the hidden colonial structures of power of modernity's global design on suicide knowledge. Our intent is to argue, specifically from the perspective of coloniality and our racialized, gendered, and monetized bodies, that suicide is rather an extension of modernity's colonial genocide. From the decolonial geo and body-politics of knowledge, our discussion on modernity's Eurocentric rhetoric on suicide departs from the materialization of suicidality in our flesh. We story experiences of our bodies with life and pleas of death, within the context of our immigrant backgrounds, and as family therapists in the United States (U.S.). We adopt autopsy as an analogy from where to advance such analysis to contest Eurocentric configurations of suicide from within, but against modernity. We emphasize the hidden racism and capitalism of suicide embedded within the persuasive Eurocentric promises of the Anglo scientific method and the U.S. American Dream. We address the concepts of epistemicide, coloniality of knowledge and of being. It is our hope to contribute to further advance decolonizing possibilities to reinscribe options that would border with the current Western knowledge on suicide. This may require other configurations of the body, knowledge, hence ways of being, doing, thinking, sensing, feeling, imagining, and dreaming to coexist among pluriversal hospitable worlds of life and death.

AB  - A growing coalition of degrowth scholar-activist(s) seeks to transform degrowth into an interdisciplinary and international field bridging a rising network of social and environmental justice movements. We offer constructive decolonial and feminist critiques to foster their productive alliances with multiple feminisms, Indigenous, post-development and pluriversal thought and design (Escobar, 2018), and people on the ground. Our suggested pathway of decolonial transition includes re-situating degrowth relative to the global south and to Indigenous and other resistance movements. We see this decolonial degrowth as a profoundly material strategy of recovery, renewal, and resistance (resurgence) through practices of re-rooting and re-commoning. To illustrate what we mean by resurgence we draw from two examples where people are engaged in ongoing struggles to protect their territories from the impacts of rampant growth-Zapatista and allied Indigenous groups in Mexico, and three Adivasi communities in the Attappady region of southern India. They are building economies and ecologies of resurgence and simultaneous resistance to growth by deterritorialization. We argue that a decolonized degrowth must be what the growth paradigm is not, and imagine what does not yet exist: our separate and collective socio-ecological futures of sufficiency and celebration in the multiple worlds of the pluriverse. Together, the two cases demonstrate pathways to autonomy, sufficiency, and resurgence of territories and worlds, through persistence, innovation, and mobilization of traditional and new knowledges. We offer these as teachers for the transition to decolonial degrowth.

AB  - Although Latin American decolonial thinking has always maintained an interest in taking the theories and practices of the communities of Latin America's colonized peoples seriously, the theorization of communality and communal systems has been a new focus of the last two decades. That is, the academic decolonial dedication to diversity and difference has recently been imagined as a pluriverse of communal systems. As such, this decolonial group of thinkers has been effectively demanding that the radical theories of communality produced by Indigenous communities of the Global South be taken seriously as real and viable alternatives to capitalism and representative democracy. Nevertheless, a critical engagement with Latin American decoloniality reveals a serious oversight in communal-oriented decoloniality: it fails to engage in a serious manner the millions throughout the world who are not or are perceived as not part of any community or are exiled from their community. To demonstrate this threat within the communal-oriented vision, one can look to another (de)colonial context ubiquitously overlooked in Latin American decolonial thought: Ireland. More precisely, as a reading of James Joyce's Ulysses reveals, the communal-oriented Irish anti-colonialism of the late 19th and early 20th centuries contained a common mode of modern anti-Semitism: Jews belong to no community and uproot and hollow out the life of any community they encounter. This article argues that although the pluriversal vision of communal-oriented decoloniality is explicitly opposed to the denigration, dismissal, or rejection of any community, it can still be characterized by this other mode of othering: the denigration, villainization, and oppression of persons who are perceived as embodiments of anti-communality.

AB  - Privately-owned, state-owned and public-private renewable energy (RE) projects are increasingly criticized by social scientists. They can involve dispossessions, management and financial inequalities, and environmental problems. Research also indicates that Community Renewable Energy (CRE) projects are not without problems and dangers. In this article, I go beyond critique of renewable energy projects, without abandoning them, to develop an alternative affirmative framework for RE production in the face of mounting climate and ecological crises. I employ a productive approach to rethink RE development, that combines the diverse and community economies perspective developed by J.K. Gibson-Graham with political ecology research on alternative economies. Building on this approach and RE and CRE literature, I develop the notion of Community Renewable Energy Ecologies (CREE). CREE signify community economies involved in small-scale RE prosumption (production and consumption), or medium-scale RE prosumption and sale of energy. They adopt non- and alternative capitalist relations of ownership, production, exchange and circulation. CREE are engaged in collective ethico-political decision-making, and an oikopolitics embodying care for and affective relations with humans and more-than-humans. Such decision-making and oikopolitics are directed towards more 'thriving' and egalitarian socio-ecological futures. I identify particular ethicopolitical orientations for CREE and provide specific considerations for their constitutive elements (e.g. ownership, finance, labor, infrastructure). CREE reflect one of multiple possibilities for alternative sustainabilities in a pluriversal world.

AB  - This paper aims to reflect on children and youth literature produced in Brazil after the Law 10.639/2003, explaining to what extent it meets or does not meet what is postulated by the legal document. To do so, I make use of the notions of "identity politics" and "empolitical identity", thought by Walter Mignolo, when he discusses what is "epistemic disobedience". A dialogue with Michel Foucault starts from his reflection on episteme and based on the preface of The Words and Things. The concept of stereotype and its uses in Brazilian literature, as presented in Bastide, Brookshow and Proenca Filho, contributes to an incursion into the history of Brazilian literature for children and young people, which is divided into 5 phases, to highlight its direct relationship with the themes produced by Brazilian literature for adults, highlighting the stereotypes produced to typify black people and crystallizing a monotopic vision of these characters. As a counterpoint to this discussion, I presented a brief analysis of the book Ipe Trunk, by Jose de Alencar, in which these stereotypes manifest themselves quite clearly. This article has highlighted some literary productions of the fifth phase to demonstrate to what extent they advance deconstructing these stereotypes, pointing to pluriversal knowledge or remain in the universal system of the western episteme. In the first group, there are those books that preserve the Eurocentric cultural substrate, making some adjustments to reaccommodate characters and spaces, giving a new coloration to the myth of racial democracy. In the second group, this article has highlighted how productions based on studies of African cultures, which underlie the Afro-Brazilian one, point in the direction of plurality, thus practicing epistemic disobedience.

AB  - The concept of planetary justice has received increasing attention within the field of earth systems governance. Although a significant epistemic shift, planetary justice discussions have primarily focused on western and (re) distributive notions of justice. By doing so, planetary justice is depriving current debates of crucial dimensions of what justice has meant for different communities and organisations. These trajectories spanning the realms of social activism, research, and institutional change have historically called for more than (re)distributional approaches to justice. We argue that recentring procedural, epistemic, and recognition-based notions of justice is critical in addressing the challenges of planetary justice in both research and practice of earth systems governance. Pluralising Planetary Justice (PPJ) requires a series of epistemic shifts in the way we research and practice the governance of environmental inequalities. These shifts demand attention to the links and gaps between justice movements and scholarship beyond the industrialised North. They also require scaling debates within climate justice and developmental ethics regarding peoples' abilities to achieve well-being and the challenges of public deliberation across spatio-temporal scales. Finally, these shifts need to recognise long-lasting processes of epistemic colonialism and integrate intersectional, multispecies, intergenerational, and non-western notions of justice. We argue procedural, epistemic, and recognition-based justice are essential guiding principles and empirical standpoints to developing pluriversal and multiscale human-earth governance systems. Without appealing to procedural, recognition, and epistemic concerns, planetary justice cannot meaningfully engage with the necessary agents and trajectories or outline the normative ends to which it aims to advance in earth systems governance.

AB  - Colombia's peace process prioritised conflict-torn geographies ostensibly suffering from historical state absence. We examine the origins and afterlives of this 'territorial' peace using discourse analysis, archival research and field interviews. The state-initiated agenda exceeded the objective of structuring negotiations with FARC guerrillas, pointing to the transformative potential of social dialogue. The negotiating parties co-sponsored participatory rural development forums, which attracted numerous collectives. These diverse actors' visionary proposals to address neglected claims and conflicts influenced the government's and FARC's respective discourses, ultimately informing the 2016 peace agreement. Yet, state priorities for peace centred on international legitimation and post-conflict infrastructure development to accelerate foreign investment in export-oriented mining, oil extraction, and agri-business. The beleaguered FARC challenged government's narratives while struggling to rebuild organisational legitimacy and prevent fragmentation. Subsequent disappointments with fraught territorial development plans, a new government's securitization of peace programmes, and continuing violence mar the post-agreement period. Prior contributors to participatory forums have joined contentious actions against neglectful austerity, extractivist maldevelopment and targeted assassinations. Thus, we argue that Colombia's international lessons may reside less in governmental pacification programmes - the potential of state-sponsored participatory dialogues notwithstanding - than in resilient (post-)conflict communities open to exercising their peace imagination while remaining mobilised against new-and-old violences. Furthermore, the territorial peace saga illustrates productive overlaps between critical peace geographies and socio-territorial analysis - especially the territorial restructuring induced by neoliberal economic policies, the violent multiple territorialities of differentiated state presence in geographical peripheries and pluriversal struggles against ontological occupation addressed herein.

AB  - Through a consideration of literacies in theory and international policy, this article pushes at the edges of existing frameworks of functional and sociocultural literacies. In critique of existing policy directives, the author explores an approach to literacy that engages in the affective and posthuman relationality of human and environment and in the plurality of literacies globally that are overshadowed in prevailing models of literacy education. The author was motivated by a commitment to literacy education responsive to a world that is unsustainable in its current practices, to a world that faces increasing fragmentation and vulnerability (socially and ecologically) while certain types of expertise, technologies, and global infrastructures continue to proliferate. As a mainstay of education and a tool of social change, literacies are inseparable from policy and practices of sustainability, equity, and development. Pluriversality is a concept emerging from decolonial theory that provides a counternarrative to contemporary Northern assumptions of the universal. Building on a history of ideas around pluriversality gives sociopolitical and ecological momentum to affect and relationality in literacy studies. The author challenges normative constructions of literacy education as Eurocentric and neocolonial, effectively supporting a pedagogy that normalizes certain practices and people and, by extension, sustains inequity and environmental degradation. Through interwoven research projects, the author highlights the contentious aspects of functional and sociocultural approaches to literacy and the possibilities of moving beyond them. In doing so, the author describes and demonstrates the practical and political implications of affect theory and relationality in literacies education in a plural anthropocenic world.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this study is to explore in depth the anatomy of post-truth in the quest to set a new research agenda. The author interrogates knowledge production/dissemination and the political positions of those behind them. This study diagnoses and challenges existing claims of supremacy of certain hegemonic epistemological and ontological orthodoxies that have been weaponized. Design/methodology/approach This study philosophically engages with different worlds of credible 'pluriversal' knowledge(s) and leads to the exposure of historically 'taken-for-granted' definitions of the nature and composition of acceptable truth and how it is deeply entrenched in interest group politics. Findings Each generation in different contexts has had to battle with specific troubling forces of deception and organized hypocrisy. Here, both new social actors and incumbents influence the disgruntled, deceive the gullible or connect with the enlightened masses at the emotional level whilst strongly undermining the rules-of-logic and fact-based discourses using disruptive social media technologies. The author specifies how the five P's: political power, profits, populism, politics and the private visions of technologists and scientists will continue to play very influential roles in how knowledge production will affect future policies and global governance. Social implications - Based on historicized explanations, the author argues that deception and mass ignorance as weaponized features of global governance and its capitalist order are typical Machiavellian strategies for gaining control over knowledge production/information dissemination. Massive changes are not expected in the future unless society and academia introduce novel science, technology and political platforms for engaging society and policy-makers. Originality/value The author provides ample historical illustrations to support the claims made in this study that public insights into the postulated structures of post-truth remain extremely superficial, making people insufficiently informed to engage in crucial discourses about knowledge production and dissemination that affect their futures. This study provides several ingredients for stimulating further debate.
